I can assist with exploring the codebase, implementing features, or debugging issues.\n\nWould you like me to switch to ACT MODE to start working on specific tasks, or do you have a particular planning discussion in mind?"

The codebase looks well-structured with background services, content scripts, and React components.\n\nSince we're in PLAN MODE, I'd like to understand what you'd like to work on:\n\n1. What specific task or feature would you like to focus on? (e.g., improving the DeepSeek integration, enhancing WebSocket functionality, adding new UI components, debugging an issue)\n\n2. Are you currently facing any challenges with the existing codebase that need addressing?\n\n3. What's your priority - new features, optimization, bug fixes, or something else?\n\nThe project has several interesting components like the prompt controller, WebSocket manager, and various UI drawers. I'm ready to help you plan the next steps for your development work!"
