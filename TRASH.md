The codebase looks well-structured with background scripts, content scripts, and presentation components.\n\nSince we're in PLAN MODE, I'd like to understand what you'd like to work on:\n\n1. Current Development Focus: Are you looking to add new features, fix bugs, refactor code, or explore the existing architecture?\n\n2. Specific Areas of Interest: \n   - The WebSocket management system (ws-manager-new.ts, ws-connection.ts)\n   - The AI chat controller (deepseek-controller.ts, prompt-controller.ts)\n   - UI components in the presentation layer\n   - Background service worker functionality\n\n3. Current Challenges: Are there any particular issues you're facing or features you want to implement?\n\n4. Development Goals: What would you like to achieve with this session?\n\nOnce I understand your priorities, I can help create a detailed plan for implementation. What would you like to focus on first?"
